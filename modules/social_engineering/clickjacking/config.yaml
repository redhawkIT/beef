            description: "Allows you to perform basic multi-click clickjacking. The iframe follows the mouse, so anywhere the user clicks on the page will be over x-pos,y-pos. The optional JS configuration values specify local Javascript to exectute when a user clicks, allowing the page can give visual feedback. The attack stops when y-pos is set to a non-numeric values (e.g. a dash). <br /><br />For a demo, visit /demos/clickjacking/clickjack_attack.html with the default settings (based on browser they may have to be adjusted)."
